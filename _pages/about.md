Hi!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my academic page, where I share my journey, projects, and aspirations. I'm currently a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in `Computer Science & Technology` at `BIT`.

My academic journey has been driven by a deep passion for `software engineering` and `web development`. Throughout my undergraduate years, I've dedicated myself to mastering `front-end` technologies and delving into the intricate world of `HCI & big data visualization`.

I am now in the process of applying for a master's degree in Computer Science or Electrical and Computer Engineering in Canada, aiming to further my expertise and open new horizons in my professional journey.
